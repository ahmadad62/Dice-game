This code defines several functions that implement a simple dice game. The start function is called when the user clicks a button to start the game. It hides the player input fields and displays the dice-rolling interface.

The fire function is called when the user clicks a button to roll the dice. It generates two random numbers between 1 and 6, representing the values of the two dice, and displays the corresponding dice images. It then compares the two dice values and displays a message indicating which player won, or a message indicating a draw if the dice values are the same.

The reset function reloads the current page, effectively resetting the game.
